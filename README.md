# Company-Website

This is a Basic Project showcasing how to work with React Router. I can use this foundational knowledge to build production project, this is just a sample. 

In this project I have made a nav bar containing links that will render different components.

this is not exactly done usibg styles fully , I have used bootstrap for layout and some class styles, will update it further should there be a need.

first link opens to home page
Second link opens to basic image and text
third link opens and renders a website containing product image and description. The data is fetched using api and takes few seconds to load

fourth link opens a basic user login. The user should enter all input fields and only then the button accepts the data and shows when it's clicked. 
User can also use Enter key to do the same with the same condition. 

The data is displayed with a remove button incase the user wants to change and enter new data. The user is alerted with a prompt that asks if the user wants to remove the data.
if the response is yesm data is removed else it remains intact.

I will update further and add more links and depth to the page to make it more respnsive and user frendly.
